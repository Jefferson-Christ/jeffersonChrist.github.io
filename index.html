                I’m Jefferson Christ, a dedicated and reliable individual with a diverse skill set, making me a strong candidate for a variety of roles. 
                I have experience in customer service, leadership, and technical fields, and I thrive in both team environments and when working independently. 
                During my time as a Concession Stand Operator at Wild Animal Safari, I learned how to work efficiently in a fast-paced setting while ensuring that customers received top-notch service. 
                As a Film Crew Leader at Buffalo High School, I led a team and managed technical equipment for live-streaming high-school sports events, demonstrating my ability to take charge and communicate effectively with others.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have a strong technical background, with expertise in C# programming, and I hold both PC Pro and Security Pro certifications from CompTIA Testout. 
                My success in the SkillsUSA competitions, where I earned second and third place in the Computer Application & Video Game Development categories, highlights my passion for technology and problem-solving.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m eager to contribute my skills in leadership, customer service, and technology to a team or organization that values these qualities. 
                With my experience and commitment to growth, I can make a valuable impact wherever I go.
